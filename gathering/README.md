# Gathering [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/backspace/gathering.svg?branch=primary)](https://travis-ci.org/backspace/gathering)

This is a PouchDB-backed offline data-gathering application to organise a
live-action puzzle-solving adventure game.

For expediency, it’s currently coupled to a particular adventure, but eventually
I’d like to generalise it while sharing components. Engines?
