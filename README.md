# Cr2016site [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/backspace/adventure-registrations.svg?branch=primary)](https://travis-ci.org/backspace/adventure-registrations)

This site is to advertise and collect registrations for a specific adventure. If it goes well, I may generalise it for other instances of that adventure. The eventual dream is to make it adaptable enough to accommodate registrations for any adventure I organise.

To start your Phoenix app:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
