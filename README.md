# AdventureRegistrations [![.github/workflows/ci.yml](https://github.com/backspace/adventure-registrations/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/backspace/adventure-registrations/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This site is to advertise and collect registrations for a specific adventure. If it goes well, I may generalise it for other instances of that adventure. The eventual dream is to make it adaptable enough to accommodate registrations for any adventure I organise.

To start your Phoenix app:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
