# Adventures

This is a monorepo to support various adventures.

* `registrations`: an Elixir/Phoenix application to advertise and collect registrations
* `unmnemonic_devices_vrs`: a Rust/Axum server for a Twilio-driven voice response system

The [`gathering`](https://github.com/backspace/adventure-gathering) application
will likely migrate into here eventually.
