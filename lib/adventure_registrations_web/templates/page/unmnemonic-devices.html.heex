    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      Want to stop obsessing about how most of your family perished in the
      dramatic coastal floods of this past summer? Need to block out those
      terrible experiences you had when martial law was declared? Having
      nightmares about the tornados that obliterated Calgary?
      By following the state-of-the-art procedure we’ve developed
      (patent pending), you can leverage knowledge stores to help you forget
      about everything that’s been bothering you lately.

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      When you encounter a phrase that represents a traumatic incident you’ve
      barely survived and tell it to our advanced processing system, you’ll
      receive kinetic instructions. If you follow them properly, the catharsis
      will purge your pain.
